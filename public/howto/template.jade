    | Creating templates with JOM is simple and easy and it's as it should be,
    | "a template".
  p 
    | Templates have a few rules to make your life easier when you develop.
    | as an Architectural Developer (see Definitions below), you will have to
    | think a head. Because any change you make to the template it will have a
    | riple like effect on multiple pages (whereever it has been used)
  p
    | To put it simple is to think of it as if you could be able to change the
    | way that the dropdown `&lt;select&gt;` tag works
